## Company growth prediction

The aim of this project is to track progressive trends of companies based on the numbers of followers and employees on the LinkedIn platform. The increase in the number of followers of a company could be considered as an indirect measure of its growth. The number of employees is a measure of the size of the company. This initial analysis answers two important questions about the companies:
1. It is possible to predict the progressive trend in a company based upon its current size and hiring rate.
2. This data can help to make a decision about the company with the maximum potential for growth in the coming years.

The dataset used for this analysis is [available at thinknum.](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/tag/data-sources/) 

For this project, I have used the data in the csv file. My future plan is to validate this model over other aspects of a company that defines its growth, such as stock prices and the number of available jobs. I will be using web-scraping to generate this data set and plan to employ multilinear regression and decision-tree based machine learning algorithms for analysis. 

All relevant details are included in the jupyter notebook.
